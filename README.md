AOP for Twig Extension
======================

*NB: this is still a proposal / proof of concept in the making*

Introduction

The goal of this Twig extension is to help simplify the implementation of
cross-cutting concerns (e.g. logging, security and profiling), by employing
the power of Aspect-oriented programming in Twig.
